* Get icons working. Three sizes -- avatar (60), neighbor (34), inventory (24)
  -- with different icons for each group. The neighbor group includes the others
  as well as more. The icon divs need to be their own thing instead of partially
  filling the background of a larger div. Let make-icons take multiple input
  files to help with the various combinations.

* Make exits just entities? Add exit-message and entry-message.

* In describe-full for an item, use the materials.

* Fix command parsing to allow unambiguous prefixes.

* Combat.

* Skills.

* Remove separate chat pane.
