# Getting Started

New to Atalea? Here are some tips to help to get on the right track.

### Do the introductory quests.

These quests introduce you to basic game commands and allow you to choose your
race, gender, and name. Pay attention to the green tutorial text.

### Take the boat to Arwyck.

Arwyck is the hub town for new characters. There you'll find a number of
vendors, skill trainers, and questgivers. Don't forget to accept the quest from
the dockmaster before taking the boat; it rewards silver coins that will be
useful in town.

### Use the spiritstone in the town square.

If you should happen to die during your adventures, you return to life at the
location of the last spiritstone you used.

### Join a guild and learn a skill.

By the time you reach town you will have enough karma to join a guild and learn
one of the skills it teaches. Learning a weapon proficiency is probably a good
way to start.

### Buy a weapon and some armor.

There are a number of weapon vendors in Arwyck. If you learned a weapon
proficiency, seek out the corresponding vendor and buy a basic weapon. You'll
also find a leather armor vendor in town. After you do some quests you should
earn enough silver to buy at least one or two pieces of armor.

### Explore!

In the areas around Arwyck you'll find quests, monsters, and more. You could
also try your hand at gathering or crafting if you join an appropriate guild.
